# Predicting NBA standings Â - Who will make the 2019-2020 NBA playoffs in the Western Conference?


## Overview
This is the final project for Advanced Data Science @ JHU. This project built a prediction model for winning percentage of the opposing teams in a basketball game based on the team-level and player-level statistics. After simulating the rest games in the 2019-2020 season, we present the playoffs in the Western Conference. 


## Data
The data folder contains our training and testing data scraped from BASKETBALL REFERENCE. 
* `game_stats_all.csv` - the team statistics of the first 20 games from season 2015-16 to season 2019-20. 
* `team_stats_all.csv` - the game results (W-L record and scores) for each of the remaining 62 games from season 2015-16 to 2018-19. 
* `pre_20_games.rds` - results for the first 20 games for each team of season 2019-2020
* `post_62_games_pred.rds` - predictions for the rest of season 2019-20

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The plot folder contains plots from our EDA. 
* `home_away.png` - 
* `player_ws_plot.png` - 
* `team_def_off_plot.png` - 
* `team_rank_plot.png` - 
* `team_win_plot.png` - 
* `team_ws_plot.png` - 
* `west_east.png` -

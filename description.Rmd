## Motivation and Overview
The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a professional basketball league in North America that draws the attention of many basketball fans all over the world. During the regular season, each of the 30 teams (15 in the Eastern Conference and 15 in the Western Conference) plays 82 games. At the conclusion of the regular season, the top eight teams in each conference advance to the playoffs for a chance to compete for the championship title. Towards the end of the regular season, the race for the final few playoff spots is very intense, and usually it isn't until the final game of the regular season is over when we know which teams have made the cut. As NBA fans ourselves, we are eager to find out which teams will make the playoffs this year (2019-20 NBA season), but rather than wait until next April, as data analysts, we thought it would be interesting if we could make such predictions now. We hope our analysis will lead to meaningful insights that will be of interest to NBA fans all over the world. 

## Project Objectives
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the winning percentages of the NBA teams in the Western Conference, and thus the playoff teams (the eight teams with the highest winning percentages). In addition to overall winning percentages, we will also provide predicted winning percentages for home games and for away games for each team.

We will undergo a comprehensive background study of the NBA to manually decide on what features to use. Then feature learning techniques will be applied. We also plan to evaluate different models. A successful model will predict the 2019-2020 NBA playoffs in the Western Conference. Ideally, the model could also be trained to predict the playoff teams in the Eastern Conference and finally round-by-round playoff predictions.

## Data 

### Data Source
All data were collected from the Basketball Reference website (https://www.basketball-reference.com/). The database contains player statistics including points per game, assists per game, rebounds per game, etc. of all players who have played in the NBA league since 1949-50 (the inaugural season of the NBA). The database also provides team statistics, including team 3-point percentages, winning percentages, etc. 

### Data Scraping 
We used the `rvest` package to scrape the following data from the Basketball Reference website:

* `team_stats`: Team statistics of the first 20 games played by each team from season 2016-17 to 2019-20. We would use these data to define team performance during a specific season in the feature engineering step.

* `game_stats`: Game results (W-L record and scores) for each of the remaining 62 games from season 2016-17 to 2018-19. We would use these data in the model building step. 

```{r,warning=F,message=F}
team_stats = readr::read_csv("./data/team_stats_all.csv")
game_stats = readr::read_csv("./data/game_stats_all.csv")
head(team_stats)
head(game_stats)
```

We do not include the code for web scraping in this rmarkdown file. Instead, please refer to the `data_scraping.R` file in the source folder for more details. Here we just show the first few rows of the data. 

### Data Wrangling
Data wrangling is performed throughout the whole data analysis process covering data tidying, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model building. Here we demonstrate some necessary data wrangling procedures performed to prepare the dataset for further analysis. 

We list all 30 teams in the league (both full franchasise name and abbreviation), and add an indicator to differentiate the 15 teams in the Western Conference and the 15 in the Eastern Conference.

```{r,warning=F,message=F}
library(rvest)
library(tidyverse)
library(data.table)
library(rowr)

west_ind = data.frame(
  Tm = c("CHI","LAL","POR","WAS","CHO","MIL","BRK","DET","HOU","NOP","IND","MEM","DEN","LAC","ATL","NYK","MIA","ORL","DAL","PHO",
         "SAC","UTA","MIN","SAS","CLE","TOR","BOS","PHI","GSW","OKC"),
  western = c(0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1),
  TeamName = c("Chicago Bulls","Los Angeles Lakers","Portland Trail Blazers", "Washington Wizards","Charlotte Hornets",
               "Milwaukee Bucks","Brooklyn Nets" ,"Detroit Pistons","Houston Rockets" ,"New Orleans Pelicans",
               "Indiana Pacers","Memphis Grizzlies","Denver Nuggets","Los Angeles Clippers","Atlanta Hawks",
               "New York Knicks" ,"Miami Heat","Orlando Magic","Dallas Mavericks","Phoenix Suns" ,
               "Sacramento Kings","Utah Jazz", "Minnesota Timberwolves","San Antonio Spurs","Cleveland Cavaliers",
               "Toronto Raptors" ,"Boston Celtics","Philadelphia 76ers" ,"Golden State Warriors","Oklahoma City Thunder")
)
```

We obtain the win shares stats (estimate of the number of wins contributed by a player) of the players ranked in the top 100 of the league in terms of win shares (WS) in a particular season. We then identify the win shares of the player with the highest win shares on each team. For example, in the 2017-18 season, the Dallas Mavericks (DAL) team had two players ranked in the top 100 in terms of WS: Dwight Powell (WS 6.6) and Dirk Nowitzki (WS 4.8). The highest win shares of the Dallas Mavericks team is thus 6.6.

We create a function that organizes team data in the first 20 games for all teams in a particular season. This process includes extracting from a larger database relevant variables which include number of wins, number of losses, winning percentages, total points scored by team, and total points scored by opponents. We also append conference ranking of each team at the end of the first 20 games to the data by ranking the winning percentages.

```{r,warning=F,message=F}
get_team_year_feature = function(year){
  
  #team_stats = get_team_stats() # get the team stats for all seasons
  team_stats_year = team_stats %>%

  team_stats_year[,-c(2,3)] = as.numeric(as.matrix(team_stats_year[,-c(2,3)])) # turn characters into numeric
  
  
  ## select Win, Loss, Win-Loss per, Team points, Opponent points
  team_stats_year_feature = team_stats_year %>%
    select(Tm, W, L, `W/L%`, TeamPTS, OpponentPTS) %>%

  team_stats_year_rank$WS[is.na(team_stats_year_rank$WS)] = 0
  
  return(team_stats_year_rank)
  
}

team_stats_18to19 = get_team_year_feature(2019)
head(team_stats_18to19)
```

We also create a function that organizes data of all regular season games in a particular season. This process includes extracting from a larger database relevant variables which include date of game, name of home team and visiting team, and points scored by home team and visiting team. We also append an indicator variable indicating whether the game was won by the home team by comparing points scored by home team and visiting team.

```{r,warning=F,message=F}

get_game_year_feature = function(year){
  game_stats_year = game_stats %>% 
    filter(grepl(as.character(year-1),Season))
  ## game stats 
  ## the results of every game in the season 
  game_stats_feature = game_stats_year[,c(1,5,6,3,4)] 
  game_stats_feature[,c(3,5)] = as.numeric(as.matrix(game_stats_feature[,c(3,5)]))
  colnames(game_stats_feature) = c("Date","Home","HomePTS","Away","AwayPTS")
  game_stats_feature = game_stats_feature %>%
    mutate(HomeWin = ifelse(HomePTS > AwayPTS,1,0))
  return(game_stats_feature)
}
game_stats_18to19 = get_game_year_feature(2019)
head(game_stats_18to19)
```



## Exploratory Data Analysis
### Team-level 
We compared team points per game and opponent points per game of all teams by conference, and explored how these stats were related to conference standings. In general, a team that is strong in offense will have a relatively high team score per game, and a team that is strong in defense will have a relatively low opponent score per game. From the plot below, we can see that some highly ranked teams are strong both offensively and defensively (e.g. TOR), while some teams make up for their weaker offense through strong defense (e.g. IND). Thus, team points or opponent points alone may not be sufficient to quantify the strength of a team, but the use of both stats or the net score (team points - opponent points) may be more appropriate.

```{r,warning=F,message=F}

team_def_off_plot = function(year){
  team_stats_year = get_team_year_feature(year)
  conference_names <- c(`1` = "Western Conference", `0` = "Eastern Conference")
  p = team_stats_year %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = TeamPTS/20, y = OpponentPTS/20))+
    geom_point(aes(size = -ConfRank, col = factor(western)))+
    geom_text(aes(label=Tm),vjust = 0, nudge_y = 0.5)+
    geom_abline(slope = 1,intercept = 0,linetype="dashed", color = "red",size = 1)+
    facet_grid(~western, labeller = as_labeller(conference_names))+
    labs(title = paste0('Points Scored in First 20 games (Season ',year-1,'-',substr(year,3,4),")"))+
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+
    coord_fixed()+
    theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
    guides(colour=FALSE) +
    scale_size("Conference standing after 20 games",breaks=c(-15,-10,-5),labels=c(15,10,5))+
    xlab("Team Points (average per game)")+
    ylab("Opponent Points (average per game)")
  print(p)
}
team_def_off_plot(2019)
```

We next explored how the standings and W-L records of teams after 20 regular games compared to the final standings and records at the end of the regular season. The plots of conference standings show that many teams that performed well in the beginning of the regular season continued to perform well throughout the season (e.g. GSW & DEN), while some teams that were not faring well earlier on finished the season strong (e.g. HOU & UTA), and still other teams that were in the top 8 after 20 regular season games did not make it to the playoffs in the end (e.g. MEM & LAL). In the team records plot, the line shows the expected number of regular season wins if teams were to maintain the same first-20-game-winning-percentage throughout the regular season. The bandwidth represents the 95% confidence interval for predictions of regular season wins. We can see that while some teams had a consistent performance throughout the season (e.g. MIN & OKC), other teams had better (e.g. HOU) or worse (e.g. MEM) performance in the remaining 62 games. Thus, we learn that even if a team starts the season poorly, there is still an oppurtunity for the team to improve and ultimately reach the playoffs.

### Specific effect
#### Home-court advantage
The NBA regular season consists of each team playing 82 games, 41 at home and 41 away. We examined home and away records of teams to better understand home-court advantage in the NBA. We can see that most teams have a better record playing at home with a few exceptions (i.e. CHI & MIA). The home-court advantage is more prominent for some teams (e.g. DEN & SAS) while mattering less for other teams (e.g. GSW & OKC).

### Player-level
Basketball is a team sport, but the value of individual talent is not to be overlooked. Win shares is a metric that is designed to estimate an individual player's contribution to the team in terms of wins. We identify the win shares of the player with the most win shares on each team. We can see that teams that have a dominant player tend to perform better.

## Feature Engineering
The performance of a team could be captured by both the team-level and player-level statistics. The team-level features that could be included in our current model were:
* number of W and L, W/L percentage, conference rank
* team total/average points, oppponent total/average points
* other secondary statistics

The player-level features that could be incorporated in the team performance metrics were

* number of league top (50-100) win share players in the team
* highest win share value in the team
